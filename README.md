# Rogue-like Game

## Project Description

A rogue-like game written in Java, using the JavaFX platform and a PostgreSQL database to store the current game state.

This was an enjoyable, two-sprint project we had to implement in a matter of two weeks at school to practice OOP concepts and programming in Java.

## Game Features

- Save, load and pause game
- Game menu
- Player-tracking camera movement
- Different enemy types (unique behaviors, movements and stats; actively attack player)
- Multiple maps
- Player inventory
- Restriction of movement (player cannot run into walls and monsters)
- Pick up objects that influence player stats (potions, armors, keys to open doors)
